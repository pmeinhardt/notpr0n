- from 1: **CA=O** => CB=P, CC=Q, CD=R, CE=S, CF=T, CG=U
- from 3: DA=V, DB=W, DC=X, DD=Y <= **DE=Z**

Visualize and complete (first letter determines line, second column):

--|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
A | A | B | C | D | E | F | G
B | H | I | J | K | L | M | N
C | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U
D | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B
E | C | D | E | F | G | H | I
F | J | K | L | M | N | O | P
G | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W

And the message from 5 reads:

`T H E A N S W E R I S P O P U L A R`
